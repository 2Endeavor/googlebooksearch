# GooglebookSearch
The GoogleBookSearch App uses React to build a responsive application. 
The app is deployed on Heroku and allows the user to quickly search for books of interest.


Once viewed the books can be saved to a list, made possible by a Mongo database, where they can be quickly retrieved when opportunity presents itself to sitdown, grab a good book and get lost in another world.


In additon to creating a list of books that are a personal "must read" this application also gives the ability to remove books from your list.


I hope you enjoy this app and that it leads you to a good book.
